- description: Execute backlog orchestrator in dry-run mode for safe schedule planning and readiness checks.
- primary_command: `npm run -s backlog:orchestrator -- --dry-run`
- cron: `*/15 * * * *`

## Code Exploration Standard
- Interpret jmunchcode/jmucnhcode as local symbol-map indexing requests.
- Do not use jcodemunch/jcode for indexing.
- Use filesystem MCP + rg + local symbol-map scripts first, then repo_mapper when available.
